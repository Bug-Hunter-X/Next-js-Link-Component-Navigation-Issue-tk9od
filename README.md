# Next.js Link Component Navigation Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue with the Next.js Link component where the navigation doesn't function correctly.  The issue is related to how the Link component interacts with the client-side routing and potential conflicts with other parts of the application, such as improper use of `router.push` or missing page configurations.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Click the 'Go to Profile' link. Observe that navigation does not happen correctly.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing the code and addressing potential conflicts or configuration issues.  Ensure that your pages are correctly configured and accessible, and verify that there are no conflicting JavaScript functions interfering with the navigation behavior. This could be due to asynchronous actions or improper use of the Next.js `router` object.
